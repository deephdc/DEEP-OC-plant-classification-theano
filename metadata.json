        "The deep learning revolution has brought significant advances in a number of fields [1], primarily linked to",
        "image and speech recognition. The standardization of image classification tasks like the [ImageNet Large Scale",
        "Visual Recognition Challenge](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/) [2] has resulted in a reliable way to",
        "compare top performing architectures.\n",

        "The use of deep learning for plant classification is not novel [3, 4] but has mainly focused in leaves and has",
        "been restricted to a limited amount of species, therefore making it of limited use for large-scale biodiversity",
        "monitoring purposes.\n",

        "This Docker container contains a trained Convolutional Neural network optimized for plant identification using",
        "images. The architecture used is an ResNet50 [5] network using Lasagne on top of Theano.. A detailed article",
        "about this network and the results obtained with it can be found in [6].\n",

        "As training dataset it has been used the great collection of images which are available in PlantNet under a ",

        "plant species of Western Europe. These species are distributed in 1500 genera and 200 families.\n",
